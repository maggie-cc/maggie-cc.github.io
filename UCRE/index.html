                <p>My team title changed <b>from visual designer to general manager</b>. In the first couple of weeks when our team worked together, I was responsible for designing the visual part for all the team assignments. Since during this time I was also doing a bit of the general manager’s work including keeping the team up with deadlines, setting up meetings and others throughout, our team thought the general manager’s role also fits me, so I became the manager in the second part of our time working together.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-center mt-5 mb-5 alert alert-info" role="alert">Executive Summary</h4>
                <P>In this team project for User-Centered Research and Evaluation, we worked with the Kelly Strayhorn Theater (KST) located in the East Liberty of Pittsburgh, a community-based theater that focuses on exhibiting experimental performance art works. An essential aspect of the KST’s mission is to facilitate close connections and deep engagement with their viewers. But this has become a challenging task due to the current circumstance under COVID-19.<br></p> 

                    <p>We first investigated user needs with different research methods and refined our ideas with feedback from users. we conducted competitive analysis research, contextual interviews, artifact analysis, storyboard speed dating, think alouds and experience prototyping to help gather insights.<br></p>
                    
                    <p>Through speed dating, we found that many users not only seek a sense of connection and confirmation during the performance, but they also have concerns for their privacy when engaging with other users online, so it became an important task for us designers to balance between innovation and privacy.<br></p>
                    
                <h4 class="text-center mt-5 mb-4 solution alert alert-info" role="alert">Solution</h4>
                <p class="summary"><b>As the solution, we designed a virtual viewing platform that allows the audience to choose their own digital avatars and interact with others through emoji, voice and comments with the option of turning these functions off during the performance. The use of digital avatars keeps the viewers’ identities anonymous while the other features encourage them to engage with others.</b>

                <h4 class="text-center mt-5 mb-4 alert alert-info" role="alert">Problem Space</h4>
                <p class="space">We took on the project with three questions in mind: ways to increase customer participation and donation, ways to encourage people to engaged with others unlike themselves, ways to transform the physical theater experiences into a virtual one. After some research, we <b>narrowed down our focus to finding an innovative way to increase viewer engagement in an online setting for the KST.</b>
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-center mt-5 mb-4 alert alert-info" role="alert">Method</h4>
                <p>Some research methods we used include <b>competitive analysis research, contextual interviews, artifact analysis, storyboard speed dating, think alouds and experience prototyping.</b></p>
                <h4 class="text-center mt-5 mb-4 alert alert-info" role="alert">Evidence</h4>
                <p>“Virtual Theater is not the same feel. You don’t get to feel the vibe of the audience. I keep checking social media to ensure that others feel the same way.”<br></p>
                <p>“ Being able to see comments is great...But in a real in-person show, you don’t get to hear what everyone is thinking. That would be too distracting for the viewers. Usually just the laughs, the claps are enough.”<br></p>
                <p class="evidence">“Being able to move around virtually during the performance makes it so much more interesting!” <br></p>
                
                <h4 class="text-center mt-5 mb-4 alert alert-info" role="alert">Insights</h4>
                <p>Many frequent theater-goers expressed the desire that when they started watching theater shows online, they craved a sense of connection they could build with their friends with watching in-person shows.<br></p>

                    Currently, the chat window is what most viewers use to seek for confirmation and reassurence during the show. However, constantly checking the chat window distracts the participant from focusing on the show.<br></p>
                    
                    Privacy is a factor that many people value when attending shows in an online setting. It’s important to find the balance between risk and innovation for the design.</p>
